sophie has come online

hmm??#sophie

the outside. the sun. the bright. the people. the loud. the#ren

oh, i've heard about this#sophie
apparently you can#sophie
hmm, god, what was it?#sophie
apparently you can buy stuff in person????#sophie
and you bring it home yourself??? instead of waiting on the post??#sophie

wait what the fuck? that's so convenient#ren

hahaha#sophie
whatcha doing outside, then, huh?#sophie

my cupboards are bare#ren
so i must brave the cold light of day#ren
tell papa i did my best#ren
take care of little jackie#ren
and clean my laptop with a brick please and thank u#ren

you are such a peanut#sophie

ty ty i'll be here all week#ren
nah this sucks tho#ren
it took me like hhhalf a hour to even make it down here#ren
and i missed the bus, of course,#ren
because this city hates me specifically#ren

ohhh my friend :(#sophie
i mean,, you know i was joking before, right?#sophie
going outside isn't thaaaaat bad eheh#sophie

aha yeah i know i know#ren
it's more just like..#ren
i dunno!! some part of my dumb little lizard brain just wants me to sit in the dark and play shitty video games#ren

that's real#sophie

and every time i'm like...... sunlight? exercise?? literally just stepping one foot outside????#ren
my fight or flight reflex bursts in to the room like one of those funky little possums#ren
it goes all :V :V :V :V and then hhSsSsssSsses and shreds through my curtains and drinks all my wine#ren

i've always liked those little guys#sophie
but yea i getcha#sophie
it's,, hard to get past that#sophie

a ha#ren
i mean, how did you manage it, man?? for real?#ren

(not a man!)#sophie

(sorry!)#ren

i wish i knew, though :s#sophie
ugh, i'm sorry#sophie
i guess,,,#sophie
even just getting a diagnosis helped#sophie
like, a lot.#sophie

mmm?#ren

like, that whole time, i knew something was up#sophie
and it got in the way of Everything#sophie
i couldn't function? so i felt........ kinda broken, tbh#sophie
but i knew it wasn't my fault! because you're sick! you're doing your best! of course it's not your fault!#sophie
and everyone told me it wasn't my fault#sophie
and i rly thought that i believed that it wasn't my fault#sophie
aaaaand then? then i get this diagnosis,#sophie
and for the first time, it fits#sophie
it fits everything, checks every box, solves every puzzle,#sophie
it's like we're in the parlour room at the end of the murder mystery#sophie
and my psych is this sweet little old lady in a cardigan who definitely just accused me of killing a guy#sophie
it's like?? i'm hit by this,, fuckin' freight train of a realisation#sophie
that it... really isn't my fault that i'm like this#sophie
and it never was? and i could finally, truly believe it#sophie
and uh#sophie
anyway that's a treatise haha sorry#sophie
shrug shrug it's#sophie
you know#sophie

hey hey no that's#ren
i like that#ren
i'm really glad !!!#ren
don't get embarrassed, seriously !!#ren

ggggglgkggkg#sophie

yes, yep, exactly, that's a v good example of what you aren't meant to be doing#ren

GGKGKGKKGKLRGLKGLKG#sophie
okay sorry#sophie
i wish i knew, is the point, yea :s#sophie
i can point to a dozen little moments like that... that really did feel like big steps#sophie
but they never fixed things?#sophie
shit went back to normal (bad) a week later#sophie
but i did get better? eventually? so i guess something was changing#sophie
just... really gradually#sophie

yeah? i mean... i'm definitely not.. always on the up and up#ren
i'm kind of all over the place, honestly#ren

oh, it's a fucking scatterplot of a graph#sophie
(another speech coming sorry!)#sophie
but as long as you're trending upwards, right?#sophie
so... look for the things that help#sophie
finding the right meds#sophie
breaking bad habits#sophie
i had a friend who just needed to get his hormone levels fixed#sophie
and not even in a trans way#sophie
dumbass gets a shot in the leg every month and suddenly he can get out of bed#sophie
but yea i mean#sophie
i don't think there's any one answer#sophie
maybe the secret is just... to keep on stumbling around in the dark#sophie
at least until you figure out the Real secret#sophie

oooh, the Real secret?#ren

well,,, the cure, you know? the 'cure'. the thing that works for you#sophie
it's easy for me to say, i know, just#sophie
maybe you just gotta keep looking until you find it?#sophie

yyyeah, no, i get it#ren
i know what you mean#ren

sorry#sophie
and#sophie
sorry, you didn't come here for a big ol speech about mental health, huh?#sophie
especially one that..... doesn't fix anything at all#sophie

oh, no, i definitely did#ren
i mean i'd fuckin' love a cure here don't get me wrong but#ren
it's kinda nice knowing there's a light at the end of this particularly shitty tunnel?#ren

oh!! eheh okay well i'm v glad! <3#sophie

srsly, pal, you're a gem#ren
i really appreciate this#ren
and my bus is here! finally! so you kept me busy!#ren

i messed up, and there's no extra step orthing i can change??#ren
i can either go home, and admit that...... yeah, i'm still broken,#ren

You're not broken.#matt
and that everyone else has gotten better and moved on with their lives and i'm stuck here#ren
I mean, recovery can be... you know,#matt

i know! i know. it's a scatterplot, i've heard#ren
